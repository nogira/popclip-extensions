[Information on how to make your own extension.](https://github.com/pilotmoon/PopClip-Extensions)

While you usually need to understand either applescript or shell to make an extension, if you copy my code, and just edit the python script embedded in the applescript, all you really need to know is some basic python. (It also runs _significantly_ faster vs. applescript or shell.)
